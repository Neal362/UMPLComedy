                <h1>Zach Martina</h1>
                <p>Zach Martina is hugely popular in Michigan, although he has performed all across the country as well. He has been on stage at Laughfest, Laugh Your Asheville Off Festival, Rock on the Range, Gilda’s Laughfest and The World Series of Comedy. He has been on stage with huge comedy hitters, such as Michael Kosta, Rory Scovel, Tommy Johnagin, Tom Segura and Lachlan Petterson.Martina has two comedy albums, Not The Worst Dad and Skunkman. In addition to being a guest on many, many podcasts, Zach hosts his own called I Learned It From You, in which he takes a trip down memory lane with his guests to learn why they have quirks, habits and idiosyncrasies.Zach brings big energy while delivering dark jokes in a delightful manner. With his sarcastic wit and lovable arrogance, Zach takes his observations and life experiences and tries to figure out whose fault it is. It certainly can’t be his. Remember, he’s not angry, he’s just passionate about the inane topics he chooses to ponder. And he’s not screaming, he just wants to make sure you hear him!</p>
